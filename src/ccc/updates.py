"""ccc updating itself: is there a newer release on GitHub, and apply it.

The same rule as the Android app's (ccc.releases): a new version is the
repository's latest release — tag `X.Y.Z` — with the ccc artifact
(`ccc.tar.gz`) attached, and it is newer by number than what runs here.
A ccc that has no version (a checkout or build made by hand, "0.0.0-dev")
takes the newest tag its checkout contains as its version.

Looking is harmless (one request to GitHub, no token); applying runs only
on a yes — in the TUI's Update window or from the phone:
- ccc as a git checkout (bin/install.sh, the usual way): the release's tag
  is fetched and the checkout fast-forwarded to it — only on main, clean,
  with nothing of its own, while no task runs — then the install script
  runs again and the services restart;
- ccc installed from the system package (.deb): the package manager updates
  it (`apt upgrade`, ccc's APT repository); ccc only tells that there is a
  newer release and never touches /usr itself;
- ccc installed as a package (pip / pipx): the release's `ccc.tar.gz` is
  downloaded and pip-installed into the environment ccc runs from.

The result of the last look is kept in the `update_state` setting (JSON),
so every reader — the TUI, the API, the daemon's notice — sees the same.
The daemon looks every CHECK_SECONDS (check_enabled(): Settings)."""
