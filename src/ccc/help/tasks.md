# Task queue

Every conversation has a **queue of tasks** — messages ccc sends to
Claude one after another, in the same conversation. The next one goes as
soon as Claude has finished the previous one, whether you're watching or
not: you can queue an evening's work and close ccc.

Press `t` in [Conversations](conversations.md) to open the queue of the
selected conversation.

## Keys

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `a` | add a task |
| `e` / `Enter` | edit the selected task |
| `Delete` | remove it (it stays in the history as skipped) |
| `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓` | move it up / down |
| `p` | pause / resume the whole queue (a task already running finishes) |
| `o` | turn [auto-continue](limits.md) on / off |
| `Esc` | close |

The top line shows whether auto-continue is on and whether the queue
runs or is paused.

## Adding a task

`a` opens an editor: write the task (several lines are fine), set when it
may start and press `Ctrl+S` to save (`Esc` cancels).

**Run at:**

| You type | It starts |
|---|---|
| *(nothing)* | as soon as possible |
| `23:00` | today at 23:00 — tomorrow if that time has passed |
| `2026-11-02 08:30` | at that date and time |
| `reset` | right after your 5-hour usage limit resets next |

A task scheduled for later **keeps its place** in the queue, so the tasks
behind it wait too. The task list shows a *When* column, and the line
under the conversation says when the next task starts (*Next task at
23:00*).

## How a task is sent

- **Claude Code beside ccc** (conversations started with `n`): ccc waits
  until Claude is idle and pastes the task in, as if you typed it. The
  reply is right there in Claude Code.
- **Headless conversations:** each task is one `claude -p` run; the reply
  appears in ccc's transcript and the run history (`Enter` on the
  Dashboard). In a git repository the result can be committed — see
  [Git](git.md).

The message box under a headless conversation adds to the end of the same
queue.

## When something goes wrong

If a task fails, the queue stops (`✖`) and waits for you — it never
retries on its own and burns your limit. `r` runs the failed task again.
See [Usage limits & blocked queues](limits.md).
