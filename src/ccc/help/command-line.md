# Command line

Everything ccc does can be reached from the TUI; a few things also work
from the shell — e.g. in scripts or over SSH. The commands live in the
checkout's virtualenv (`~/ccc/.venv/bin/`); add it to your `PATH` or call
them with the full path. Their output is in ccc's language. Shortcuts changed with `ccc keys`
reach the running ccc when it restarts (`systemctl --user restart
ccc-tui`); changed in Settings they work right away.
