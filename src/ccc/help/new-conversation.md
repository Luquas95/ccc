# Starting a conversation

Press `n` anywhere (or the green **New conversation** button in
Conversations). The window has two halves.

![New conversation](../../../docs/screenshots/new_conversation.png)

## Directory

The project folder Claude will work in: pick one of the recent folders,
browse the folder tree, or type a path.

## Options

The same switches as on the `claude` command line. Groups marked *one*
allow only one choice.

| Group | Options |
|---|---|
| Session (*one*) | **New session** · **Continue last in directory** · **Resume selected…** (pick one of the folder's past Claude Code sessions) · **From pull request…** |
| | **As a copy (fork)** — with Continue / Resume / From PR: a new conversation that starts from that one, the original stays as it was |
| Permissions (*one*) | **Skip all permission checks** — Claude does everything without asking · **Auto-accept edits** — file edits yes, other tools ask · **Ask for everything** — every tool asks, even edits · **Only what is allowed** — whatever isn't already allowed is refused, nothing asks · **Auto mode** — Claude Code decides itself which actions are safe · **Plan only** — Claude only plans |
| Model (*one*) | Opus · Sonnet · Haiku · Fable |
| Effort (*one*) | low · medium · high · xhigh · max |
| MCP servers | **Only selected MCP servers (fewer tokens)** — see [MCP servers](#mcp-servers) |
| Other | Fallback to Sonnet when overloaded · Claude in Chrome · Safe mode |
| | **Own git worktree** — a separate checkout and branch for this conversation (`.claude/worktrees/<name>`, branch `worktree-<name>`), so it can work side by side with others in the same repository; only with a new session or one from a pull request, and with *Skip all permission checks* (ccc runs git only there). See [Git](git.md#several-conversations-in-one-folder) |

Below them:

- **Auto-continue after usage limit** (on by default) — when Claude hits
  your usage limit, the conversation waits for the reset and carries on by
  itself. Off: it stops and waits for you. See
  [Usage limits](limits.md).
- **Remote control (phone / claude.ai)** — you can also continue the
  conversation from the Claude mobile app. See
  [Remote control](remote-control.md).

Nothing ticked means Claude Code's own defaults.

## MCP servers

By default Claude Code loads every MCP server it finds — yours from
`~/.claude.json`, the folder's `.mcp.json` and the claude.ai connectors
(Gmail, Vercel…) — and puts all their tool definitions into the context of
every turn. With a few large servers that is hundreds of tools and a lot of
tokens you pay for with every message, whether the conversation needs them
or not. (One test: 543 tools without a choice, 24 with none.)

![MCP servers](../../../docs/screenshots/new_conversation_mcp.png)

Tick **Only selected MCP servers** and the servers configured for the chosen
folder appear below it; tick the ones this conversation may use. Nothing
ticked means none. ccc's own server (approvals, asking other conversations)
is always on. The choice holds for the whole conversation, is remembered
for next time and saved in presets.

- claude.ai connectors can't be picked: with this option they are all off.
- A server from the folder's `.mcp.json` appears only after you've approved
  it for that folder in Claude Code (it asks the first time); a repository
  can't get a command run just by defining a server.
- A server that has since been removed from your configuration is skipped.
- ccc stores only the names, never the server settings (they can hold
  tokens); the settings are read when Claude Code starts.

## Presets

The window remembers your last choice. If you use a few combinations
often, **Save as preset** stores the current one under a name; **Choose a
preset…** fills the window with it. Delete presets in
[Settings](settings.md).

## After Start

You're in [Conversations](conversations.md) with Claude Code open beside
ccc. Resuming a session that already has a conversation in ccc just
switches to that conversation — unless you tick *As a copy (fork)*.
