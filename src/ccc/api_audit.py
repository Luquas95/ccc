"""What the API's devices did, and the alarms (#160). If a token is ever
misused you need two things: to see afterwards who did what, and to hear of
it while it happens. So the API keeps a log (`ccc api log`, the Devices
window, GET /audit for an admin) and tells the notification channels
(Telegram / Discord, as ccc does for approvals) about what is out of the
ordinary: a new device paired, a wrong pairing code, requests with a wrong
token, a device trying more than its role allows.

Logged: everything that changes something (not GET), every refusal (401 /
403) and every pairing — never the query, the body or typed keys (they can
hold secrets); only the path and, for a new conversation, its folder."""
