"""What a device may do (#160). Every device has a role (models.ROLES): a
stolen phone or token should not be a way into the whole computer, so only
what a device needs is open to it. Weakest first:

read     only looks: every GET (lists, conversations, diffs, the events stream)
operate  also steers the conversations that exist: messages, approvals, queue,
         tasks, reviews, goals, workflows
admin    also what reaches beyond them: new conversations (any folder), keys
         typed into a terminal, prompts to live sessions, routines, reverting,
         settings, backup, updating ccc and building the app, other devices

The rules are in one table, checked before any handler runs; a path the table
doesn't know needs admin (closed by default)."""
